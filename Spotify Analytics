# For this project, I acquired Spotify data from Kaggle, proceeded to establish a table for the data insertion, and ultimately conducted data analytics utilizing SQL.

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

# After creating the table, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table

# Then, I explored the data using the following SQL

## What is the average popularity, loudness, and tempo by artist and track?
SELECT
artist_name
,track_name
,avg(popularity) as Popularity
,avg(loudness) as Loudness
,avg(tempo) as Tempo
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

## What are the Top 5 artists by populirity?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity asc
LIMIT 5
